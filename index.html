          <li>Why I Decided To Take Class On Programming</li>
           <p>I have always wanted to code. After I complete campus, I had this feeling that I did not get
           the programming skills that I was expecting to acquire in the campus. I therefore enrolled
            to programming class to get more skills in Programming.I felt that Moringa School is going to
            equip me with those skills and I therefore enrolled into the school.
